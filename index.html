				<h2 id="bio">About Me</h2>
				<article> My name is Pam Pepper. I'm originally from Michigann but I moved down to Kentucky to move-in with my then boyfriend, now fiance. Thanks to having worked in Walgreens in Michigan I was able to transfer to another Walgreens in the area where I went from Photo Tech to Shift Lead. With more responsibilities came more chances to improve my skills at speaking with customers and helping employees learn how to troubleshoot the various software and hardware around the store. <br> <br> As my now fiance was a couple years into his own career in software engineering I learned a little bit here and there, mostly just enough to peak my interest. I enrolled in Cincinnati State Technical College where I completed an Associate's of Science in Software Engineering. Through the internship program I landed a part-time position with E.C. Shaw Company as in-house IT and software support. I get to do a lot of general IT work as well as help develop and troubleshoot the in house software developed in FileMaker. Now I am attending Northern Kentucky University for my Bachelor's in Associated Software Engineering to further my skills and see what else is available.</article>

				<article>In my free time I enjoy dabbling with drawing of both paper and digital kind. I also enjoy swapping recipes with my friends, the occasional get together for board games of various types, and video games. Currently I am learning to play the piano as well. I generally enjoy many of my hobbies (video games and drawing) while watching documentaries or youtube channels like Technology Connections
				or Kurzgesagt.</article>
