			<article>In my free time I enjoy dabbling with sketching pencils, pixel art, and occasionally digital art. I also enjoy swapping recipes with my friends, the occasional get together for board games of various stripes, and video games. Currently I am learning to play the piano as well. I generally enjoy many of my hobbies (video games and drawing) while watching documentaries or youtube channels like Technology Connections
